# Basic Profile Form Example

This example shows how to use **react-hook-form-autosave** with:

- ✅ Zod validation
- ✅ Key remapping (form → API)
- ✅ Diff handling for arrays (`skills`)
- ✅ Debounced autosave

### Running

- Changes autosave automatically after 600ms
- Skills trigger `onAdd` / `onRemove` handlers
- Validation prevents invalid data from being saved

### üéâ Major Release - Undo/Redo Support & Perfect State Synchronization

This release introduces powerful undo/redo capabilities and fixes all state tracking issues that have plagued autosave implementations.

### ‚≠ê Headline Features

#### Full Undo/Redo Support
- **NEW**: Complete undo/redo system with keyboard shortcuts
  - Automatic keyboard shortcuts: `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` for undo, `Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+Z` for redo
  - Programmatic API: `undo()`, `redo()`, `canUndo`, `canRedo`
  - Smart integration with autosave - only saves when needed after undo/redo
  - `undoLastSave()` - Revert all changes since the last successful save
  - Configurable via `undo: { enabled: true }` option
  - Optional: Disable keyboard shortcuts or customize target element
  - Works seamlessly with all field types including arrays

#### Perfect State Synchronization
- **FIXED**: `hasPendingChanges` now always returns the correct value
  - Accurately tracks unsaved changes in all scenarios
  - Properly syncs when data loads from API
  - Correctly handles array field saves via `diffMap`
  - Maintains accuracy through undo/redo operations

#### Auto-Hydration
- **NEW**: Automatic form synchronization when server data loads
  - Detects when form is reset with new data from API
  - Updates baseline and saved state automatically
  - Prevents false "unsaved changes" after data loads
  - Zero configuration required (enabled by default)
  - Can be disabled with `autoHydrate: false`

### üîÑ Breaking Changes

#### Configuration Restructure
- **MOVED**: Debug flag relocated to config object for consistency
  ```typescript
  // Before (v2.x)
  useRhfAutosave({ form, transport, debug: true });
  
  // After (v3.x)
  useRhfAutosave({ form, transport, config: { debug: true } });
  ```

#### Debug Behavior
- **CHANGED**: Debug logging now defaults to `false` (previously auto-detected)
  - Must explicitly enable with `config: { debug: true }`
  - No automatic enabling in development mode
  - Prevents accidental sensitive data exposure in production

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### State Tracking Issues
- **FIXED**: `hasPendingChanges` always returning `true` (#43)
  - Introduced internal `lastSavedState` tracking
  - Properly compares current state with last successful save
  - Correctly handles server data hydration

- **FIXED**: Array fields remaining dirty after successful save (#45)
  - Form now properly resets dirty state for `diffMap` fields
  - Arrays handled via `diffMap` are correctly marked as clean

- **FIXED**: Form state out of sync after API data loads (#44)
  - Auto-hydration detects and syncs server data
  - Baseline updates when data loads
  - Eliminates false positives in pending state

#### Technical Issues
- **FIXED**: Manager initialization circular dependency error
- **FIXED**: `flush()` not working correctly
- **FIXED**: Undo/redo stack corruption when reaching boundaries

### üîß Improvements

#### Enhanced Developer Experience
- **NEW**: `hydrateFromServer(data)` method for manual sync control
- **NEW**: Comprehensive debug logging with namespaces
- **IMPROVED**: Better TypeScript types throughout
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Single `debug` configuration flag

#### Performance Optimizations
- **OPTIMIZED**: Reduced unnecessary re-renders

- **ENHANCED**: Better debounce handling for complex operations

#### Reliability
- **IMPROVED**: More robust error handling
- **ENHANCED**: Better cleanup on unmount
- **FIXED**: Race conditions in concurrent operations

### üìù Documentation

- New section on state synchronization
- Comprehensive migration guide from v2 to v3
- Better troubleshooting guides
- Interactive examples for common patterns

## [2.2.0] - 2025-09-20
- Removed `zod` dependency

## [2.1.1] - 2025-09-19

### Fixed
- **types**: Added missing `hasPendingChanges?: boolean` property to `RhfAutosaveOptions` interface

## [2.1.1] - 2025-09-19

### Fixed

- **types**: Added missing `hasPendingChanges?: boolean` property to `RhfAutosaveOptions` interface

## [2.1.0] - 2025-09-19

### Fixed

- **autosave**: Fixed multiple critical issues with debouncing and diff operations

  - Fixed "Request aborted" errors when using diffMap with higher debounce times
  - Fixed immediate flush in queueChange that was bypassing debounce
  - Improved abort controller lifecycle management to prevent race conditions
  - Enhanced error handling to properly distinguish between user aborts and failures
  - Fixed retry logic to respect abort signals

- **diffMap**: Fixed fields handled by diffMap being incorrectly included in main transport

  - Fields with diff handlers are now properly excluded from the main payload
  - Diff operations (onAdd/onRemove) are executed separately as intended
  - Prevents timeout errors when diff fields have different endpoints

- **Pending state tracking**: Fixed `isEmpty()` and `getPendingChanges()` always returning empty
  - Now properly tracks pending changes during debounce period
  - `flush()` now properly includes pending changes
  - `forceSave()` now returns a Promise for consistency

### Added

- **hasPendingChanges**: New boolean property for checking if there are unsaved changes

### Improved

- Better documentation for diffMap behavior

## [2.0.1] - 2025-09-18

### Fixed

- **autosave**: Fixed multiple network requests being sent during typing
  - Now batches all keystrokes into single request after debounce period

## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-18
